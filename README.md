# Boros Add to Pocket

WordPress plugin to add URL to Pocket via API. Created because the official Chrome extension stopped working ðŸ˜¢.

## Create a Pocket App
Visit https://getpocket.com/developer/, create new app and copy the "consumer key" 

## Method 1: wp-config.php installation:
Generate API keys via curl or Postman (ref: https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/authentication)

Register constant BOROS_POCKET in wp-config.php:

`define( 'BOROS_POCKET', array('consumer_key' => 'XXXX', 'access_token' => 'XXXX') );`

Access ajax address to get the bookmarklet: 
SITE.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=batp

## Method 2: wp-admin installation:
Acess "Settings > Add to Pocket"

1) Save Consumer key field
2) Click "Obtain a Request Token" button
3) Click the "Authorize App" link and confirm authorization in Pocket page. You will be redirected back to WordPress
4) Click "Obtain a Access Token" button

All steps are autosaved.

### ToDo

### Goals
My goals with this plugin are:

2. Study some common challenges in WordPress development:
    - Authentication and queries to an external API.
    - WordPress options page creation, using native functions.
    - Dynamic interaction with form controls using AJAX requests.
3. Maintain a public plugin with Github releases.
4. Challenge: maintain all code in on file.
